This is very much unfinished. There is much more I want to add, here are a few:

1. Follow browser style
2. Show only todays stats in popup
3. Display average stats for the previous day
4. Add page with all stats
5. Set max-height of popup
6. Port to Chrome
7. Post in extension markets

Currently data does not survive removing the extension as all data is stored locally with the extension. I might change this down the road
